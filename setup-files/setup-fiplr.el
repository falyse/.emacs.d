;; Fiplr (pronounced FIP-ler, as in Find in Project) is an Emacs package to
;; allow you to locate and open files deep within a complex directory tree,
;; using fuzzy matching.
;; A key design goal is to make Fiplr really easy to use with little-to-no
;; configuration, beyond a single key binding.
;; It is heavily inspired by Vim's ctrlp, TextMate's Command-T, and
;; Sublime's Control+P.
;; Internally it uses Grizzl to do the fuzzy searching.
